Just Bootstrap It!
For our final milestone we wanted to create a simple ecommerce site for small business owners with limited beginning capital to access resources to make their business journey a little easier. It has a list of blogs they can access for various tips and tricks, an option to book a 1-on-1 with a “professional” and a database of 5 suppliers they can access to find a clothing supplier that best suits their needs. 

For the sake of the milestone this ecommerce site is geared towards small business owners with a clothing brand; however, that could change in the future who knows! 


The Inspiration
During the pandemic of 2020, I witnessed many people on social media and real life start a business in hopes to sustain an income after major layoffs and in hopes to change their previous reality. I wanted to begin this project to help guide business owners and aspiring business owners to turn that dream into their new reality. 

How to Use
It is a pretty easy website to navigate. You are presented with a portal that you must log into and once logged in you enter the landing page. On the landing page you have 3 options:
Click on the first card which is a list of blogs you can learn business tips and tricks from.
Click on the second card and you have the chance to book a 1-on-1 with a professional to learn more about how to start your small business.
Click on the third card and access a database of clothing suppliers so that you can shorten research time and pick a supplier that best suits your needs.
In addition, you can favorite a supplier to keep in a favorites section to refer to later.
